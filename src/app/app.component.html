        <md-card-subtitle>Inclusion refers to hvaing the DHH students <i>ideally</i> integrated into regular classrooms alongside hearing classmates, with all the necessary special services available to them within the classroom itself. The responsibility of the students falls onto the regular classroom teacher instead of a special educator. </md-card-subtitle>

                <li> better self-perceptions of reading ability than those in special classes </li>
                <li> Although it might be hard at first, many past students reported having an improvement in their social lives as time went on, as their hearing peers got more familiar with communicating with them. </li>
                <li>A number of researchers have pointed out that in mainstream schools, DHH students tend to have higher levels of academic achievement than their peers who attend special schools (e.g., Allen &amp; Osborn, 1984; lynas, 1999; Moores and Kluwin, 1986; Powers, 2001</li>
                <li>A high percentage of mainstreamed DHH students reported having favourably adapted emotionally and socially, as well as in regards to their self-esteem, according to studies done by Hadjikakou (2002).</li>

                <li> Some also reported a lack of close friends, as their conversations with their peers were limited due to language differences. </li>
