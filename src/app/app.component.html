              A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON THE EXPERIENCES OF DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING INDIVIDUALS AS STUDENTS AT MAINSTREAM AND SPECIAL SCHOOLS
              <ul>
                <li> more chances for social interaction with their (hearing) classmates and teachers, and that, in this way, they acquire the necessary skills for social inclusion. </li>
                <li> better self-perceptions of reading ability than those in special classes </li>
                <li> Although it might be hard at first, many past students reported having an improvement in their social lives as time went on, as their hearing peers got more familiar with communicating with them. </li>
                <li>A number of researchers have pointed out that in mainstream seh(:K>ls deaf and hard of hearing stu- dents tend to have higher levels of ac- ademic achievement than their peers who attend special schools (e.g., Allen and Osborn, 1984; lynas, 1999; Moores and Kluwin, 1986; Powers, 2001</li>
                <li>A high percentage of mainstreamed DHH students reported having favourably adapted emotionally and socially, as well as in regards to their self-esteem, according to studies done by Hadjikakou (2002).</li>

              <ul>
                <li> Most schools had limited special services available to their DHH students, and they may struggle understanding the teacher or keeping up with classroom discussion due to this. </li>
                <li> Some students may feel uncomfortable having an interpreter or wearing hearing aids, as it could make them feel even more uncomfortable or self-conscious. </li>
                <li> Past students report feeling socially isolated and ostracised from their hearing peers due to their "disability". </li>
                <li> Some also reported a lack of close friends, as their conversations with their peers were limited due to language differences. </li>
